A mobile application that mainly focused on allowing users to save locations. Initially inspired by people easily forgetting places they went to. Made with Flutter and Firebase.

Here are some features that this application provides:

## Notes

I have deleted the firebase project, so the application will not run. However, you can still check out the code.

Also, the Google Maps API key used in this project does not belong to me. It is a key I had found online.
